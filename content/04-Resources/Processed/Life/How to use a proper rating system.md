## Rating system

Anything with a `rating` uses an integer from 1 to 7:

- 7 — **Perfect**, must try, life-changing, go out of your way to seek this out
- 6 — **Excellent**, worth repeating
- 5 — **Good**, don’t go out of your way, but enjoyable
- 4 — **Passable**, works in a pinch
- 3 — **Bad**, don’t do this if you can
- 2 — **Atrocious**, actively avoid, repulsive
- 1 — **Evil**, life-changing in a bad way

Why this scale? I like rating out of 7 better than 4 or 5 because I need more granularity at the top, for the good experiences, and 10 is too granular.
