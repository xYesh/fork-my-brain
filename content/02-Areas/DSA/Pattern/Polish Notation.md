# Reverse Polish Notation Evaluation
- There are a lot of ambiguities with Infix notation. i.e., People aren't fully aware of how to use BODMAS/PEDMAS.
	- This leads to those social media posts where different people have different solutions for one large arithmetic problem.
	- e.g., `5 * 4 + 9 - 2 / 3 + 1 = ?` the actual solution is `29.33`
- Reverse polish notation has less ambiguities.
	- e.g., `12 7 -` = `5` & not `-5`
		- Remember the ordering
