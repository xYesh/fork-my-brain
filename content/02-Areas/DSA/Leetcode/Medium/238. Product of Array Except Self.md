## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return *an array* `answer` *such that* `answer[i]` *is equal to the product of all the elements of* `nums` *except* `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.

 

>[!Example]+ Example 1
>**Input**: `nums = [1,2,3,4]`
>**Output**: `[24,12,8,6]
`

>[!Example]+ Example 2
>**Input**: `nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]`
>**Output**: `[0,0,9,0,0]
`

>[!warning]+ Constraints
>- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
>
>- `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`
>
>- The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

## Approaches
### Approach 1
- a product of all the number except itself in an array is nothing but the product of all the numbers to the left of an array and all the numbers to the right of an array.
- We can achieve this by having a left and right sum arrays and multiplying their values to get the results.
#### Complexity Analysis
##### Time
- `o(n)` as we do this using 3 loops.
##### Space
- `o(n)` as we have 2 arrays the same size as the input array.
#### Solution
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        
        int[] left = new int[nums.length];
        int[] right = new int[nums.length];

        left[0] = 1;
        for (int i=1; i<nums.length; i++) {
            left[i] = left[i-1] * nums[i-1];
        }

        right[nums.length-1] = 1;
        for (int i=nums.length-2;i>=0;i--) {
            right[i] = right[i+1] * nums[i+1];
        }

        for (int i=0; i<nums.length; i++) {
            left[i] = left[i] * right[i];
        }
        return left;
    }
}
```
#### We Can Convert the Above Problem into an o(n) Space Complexity as Shown Below

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        int[] left = new int[nums.length];
        left[0] = 1;
        for (int i=1; i<nums.length; i++) {
            left[i] = left[i-1] * nums[i-1];
        }

        int R = 1;
        for (int i=nums.length-2;i>=0;i--) {
            R = R * nums[i+1];
            left[i] = left[i] * R;
        }
        return left;
    }
}
```
