> [!learnings]
> - Think of how a stack works. 
> 	- In a stack, all manipulations can only be done to the top element. i.e., the elements below it cannot be modified before you can remove the top element
> - What this means is that for every element, the min element so far is decided at the time of insertion and cannot be changed.
## Problem Statement

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the `MinStack` class:

	
- `MinStack()` initializes the stack object.
	
- `void push(int val)` pushes the element `val` onto the stack.
	
- `void pop()` removes the element on the top of the stack.
	
- `int top()` gets the top element of the stack.
	
- `int getMin()` retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

You must implement a solution with `O(1)` time complexity for each function.

 

>[!Example]+ Example 1
>**Input**: `["MinStack","push","push","push","getMin","pop","top","getMin"]
[[],[-2],[0],[-3],[],[],[],[\|],[-2],[0],[-3],[],[],[],[]]`
>**Output**: `[null,null,null,null,-3,null,0,-2]`
>**Explanation**: `MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
>minStack.push(-2);
>minStack.push(0);
>minStack.push(-3);
>minStack.getMin(); // return -3
>minStack.pop();
>minStack.top();    // return 0
>minStack.getMin(); // return -2
>`

>[!warning]+ Constraints
>- `-2^31 <= val <= 2^31 - 1`
>
>- Methods `pop`, `top` and `getMin` operations will always be called on non-empty stacks.
>
>- At most `3 * 10^4` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `getMin`.

Basically we need to implement a min-heap. or not.


```
## Approaches
### Approach 1
- When we deal with a stack, all the manipulations are only done to the item on the top of the stack.
	- i.e., you can't really do anything to the items below the top item. Therefore, the min value at every level will always be the same
	- ![Pasted image 20250111083959.png](../../../../02-Areas/DSA/Leetcode/Medium/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250111083959.png)
- We can store the corresponding min at every level and modify it if we find an even smaller number.
#### Complexity Analysis
##### Time
- `o(1)` for every operation as we are pre-calculating the results at every level using basic comparisons.
##### Space
- `o(n)` as we need to store the results for every level.
#### Solution
```Java
class MinStack {
    Stack<Pair> stack = new Stack<>();

    public MinStack() {
        stack = new Stack<>();
    }
    
    public void push(int val) {
        if (stack.isEmpty()) {
            stack.push(new Pair(val,val));
        } else {
            int prevMin = stack.peek().min;
            if (val < prevMin) {
                stack.push(new Pair(val,val));
            } else {
                stack.push(new Pair(val,prevMin));
            }
        }
        return;
    }
    
    public void pop() {
        stack.pop();
        return;
    }
    
    public int top() {
        return stack.peek().no;
    }
    
    public int getMin() {
        return stack.peek().min;
    }

    class Pair {
        public Pair(int no, int min) {
            this.no = no;
            this.min = min;
        }
        int no;
        int min;
    }
}
```

### Approach 2
- It's possible to get marginally better space complexity by storing the min in another stack as we waste a lot of space just storing the same min repeatedly.
	- The new solve will also still have the same space complexity of `o(n)` but it will be a smaller `o(n)` compared to the above solve.
