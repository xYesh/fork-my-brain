## Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return *the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount*. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

 

>[!Example]+ Example 1
>**Input**: `coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11`
>**Output**: `3`
>**Explanation**: `11 = 5 + 5 + 1
>`

>[!Example]+ Example 2
>**Input**: `coins = [2], amount = 3`
>**Output**: `-1
`

>[!Example]+ Example 3
>**Input**: `coins = [1], amount = 0`
>**Output**: `0
`

>[!warning]+ Constraints
>- `1 <= coins.length <= 12`
>
>- `1 <= coins[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
>
>- `0 <= amount <= 10^4`

## Approaches
### Approach 1
- Top down dynamic programming problem.
- We need to iterate through the coins recursively till we find the case where the amount is perfectly zero.
	- In case where amount becomes less than zero, we need to discard that entire path.
	- This can be done by just skipping it by adding a pre check like I've done below
		- OR
	- We can return `-1` if the amount goes less than zero and we can add a check for that in the calling function.
- We also need to handle cases where somewhere down the chain, we've entered into an unsolvable path. 
- add memoization or we will timeout. 
#### Complexity Analysis
##### Time 
- `o(A*n)` where `A` is the amount, `n` is the number of coins. In the worst case, the recursive tree will have a height of `A` 
##### Space
- `o(A)` where `A` is the amount. This is the space occupied by the memoization map.
#### Solution
```Java
class Solution {
    HashMap<Integer,Integer> memo = new HashMap<>();
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        int sol = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int coin: coins) {
            sol = Math.min(sol,coinChangeHelper(coins,amount));
        }
        return sol == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : sol;
    }

    public int coinChangeHelper(int[] coins,int amount) {
        if (memo.containsKey(amount)) {
            return memo.get(amount);
        }
        if (amount == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int temp = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int coin : coins) {
            if (amount - coin < 0) {
                continue;
            }
            int res = coinChangeHelper(coins,amount-coin);
            //we get this case if we enter into a unsolvable path.
            if (res == Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                continue;
            }
            temp = Math.min(temp, res + 1);
        }
        memo.put(amount,temp);
        return temp;
    }
}
```


### Approach 2 - Tabulation
- We create a dp array with size `1` greater than the amount. 
	- This is because we use the `amount` for memoization.
- we then fill the map with details on the smallest number of coins required to form that particular amount.

- When we are at 4. We loop through the coin denominations.
	- When we choose the coin `1`, we just compare it to `4 - 1 = 3` field. i.e., the min number of coins to form 3 is `1`, the `3` coin. 
		- We just need to add one more coin to that `3` coin to form `4`.
#### Complexity Analysis
##### Time 
- `o(A*n)` where `A` is the amount, `n` is the number of coins. In the worst case, the recursive tree will have a height of `A` 
##### Space
- `o(A)` where `A` is the amount. This is the space occupied by the memoization map.
#### Solution
```java
public class Solution {
  public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
    int max = amount + 1;
    int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
    Arrays.fill(dp, max);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < coins.length; j++) {
        if (coins[j] <= i) {
          dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coins[j]] + 1);
        }
      }
    }
    return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
  }
}

```
