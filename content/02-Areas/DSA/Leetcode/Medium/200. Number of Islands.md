## Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return *the number of islands*.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

>[!Example]+ Example 1
>**Input**: `grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]`
>**Output**: `1
`

>[!Example]+ Example 2
>**Input**: `grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]`
>**Output**: `3
`

>[!warning]+ Constraints
>- `m == grid.length`
>
>- `n == grid[i].length`
>
>- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
>
>- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

### External Resources

## Scratchpad
```
this is typical BFS question. we just need to start a BFS search every time we see an island while iterating and then mark all the seen land in a seen list. 
```
## Approaches
### Approach 1
- Go through all the nodes in a typical DFS fashion and mark them as seen as when you see them.
#### Complexity Analysis
##### Time `o(n)`
- We need to go through all the nodes once or twice in the worst case scenario.
##### Space `o(n)`
- We need to initialize a seen list the same size as the grid array.
#### Solution
```Java
class Solution {
	//From the BFS note
    int[][] directions = new int[][] {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};
    
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        int noOfIslands = 0;
        char[][] seen = new char[grid.length][grid[0].length];
        
        //Setting default value as 0
        for (char[] temp : seen) {
            Arrays.fill(temp,'0');
        }
        for (int i=0; i < grid.length;i++) {
            for (int j=0;j < grid[0].length;j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '1' && seen[i][j] != '1') {
                    noOfIslands++;
                    helper(i,j,grid,seen);
                }
            }
        }
        return noOfIslands;
    }

    private void helper(int i, int j, char[][] grid, char[][] seen) {
        if (i < 0 || i >= grid.length || j < 0 || j >= grid[0].length || grid[i][j] == '0' || seen[i][j] == '1') {
            return;
        }

        seen[i][j] = '1';
        for (int[] direction : directions) {
            helper(i+direction[0],j+direction[1],grid,seen);
        }
    }
}
```
