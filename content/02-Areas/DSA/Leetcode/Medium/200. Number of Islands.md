## Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return *the number of islands*.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

>[!Example]+ Example 1
>**Input**: `grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]`
>**Output**: `1
`

>[!Example]+ Example 2
>**Input**: `grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]`
>**Output**: `3
`

>[!warning]+ Constraints
>- `m == grid.length`
>
>- `n == grid[i].length`
>
>- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
>
>- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.
