## Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree, *determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST)*.

A valid BST is defined as follows:

	
- The left <span data-keyword="subtree">subtree</span> of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
	
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
	
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

>**Input**: `root = [2,1,3]`
>**Output**: `true
`

>
>**Input**: `root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]`
>**Output**: `false`
>**Explanation**: `The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.

>[!warning]+ Constraints
>- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.

>- `-2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1`

### Approach 1
- Based on if you are going left or right you need to update the max and min allowable values.
	- We just do a DFS recursively and check one node at a time.
#### Complexity Analysis
##### Time `0(n)`
- This is because we have to iterate through all the nodes.
##### Space `o(n)`
- This is in the worst case where we have a straight line of nodes and need to hold it all in the stack.
#### Solution
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean validate(TreeNode root, Integer low, Integer high) {
        // Empty trees are valid BSTs.
        if (root == null) {
            return true;
        }

        // The current node's value must be between low and high.
        if (
            (low != null && root.val <= low) ||
            (high != null && root.val >= high)
        ) {
            return false;
        }

        // The left and right subtree must also be valid.
        return (
            validate(root.right, root.val, high) &&
            validate(root.left, low, root.val)
        );
    }

    public boolean isValidBST(TreeNode root) {
        return validate(root, null, null);
    }
}
```
