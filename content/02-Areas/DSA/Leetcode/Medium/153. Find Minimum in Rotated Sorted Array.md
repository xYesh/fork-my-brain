## Problem Statement

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is rotated between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

	
- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
	
- `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that rotating an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], …, a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], …, a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of unique elements, return *the minimum element of this array*.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n) time`.

 

>[!Example]+ Example 1
>**Input**: `nums = [3,4,5,1,2]`
>**Output**: `1`
>**Explanation**: `The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
>`

>[!Example]+ Example 2
>**Input**: `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`
>**Output**: `0`
>**Explanation**: `The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
>`

>[!Example]+ Example 3
>**Input**: `nums = [11,13,15,17]`
>**Output**: `11`
>**Explanation**: `The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times.
>`

>[!warning]+ Constraints
>- `n == nums.length`
>
>- `1 <= n <= 5000`
>
>- `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
>
>- All the integers of `nums` are unique.
>
>- `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.
