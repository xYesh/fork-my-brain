## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `i^th` step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.

Return *the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor*.

 

>[!Example]+ Example 1
>**Input**: `cost = [10,<u>15</u>,20]`
>**Output**: `15`
>**Explanation**: `You will start at index 1.
>- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
>The total cost is 15.
>`

>[!Example]+ Example 2
>**Input**: `cost = [<u>1</u>,100,<u>1</u>,1,<u>1</u>,100,<u>1</u>,<u>1</u>,100,<u>1</u>]`
>**Output**: `6`
>**Explanation**: `You will start at index 0.
>- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
>- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
>- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
>- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
>- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
>- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
>The total cost is 6.
>`

>[!warning]+ Constraints
>- `2 <= cost.length <= 1000`
>
>- `0 <= cost[i] <= 999`

## Approaches
### Approach 1 - Recursion with Memoization
- There are two choices in every step, We can either go up with `1` step or `2` steps.
	- Therefore, we can just <span style="background:rgba(240, 107, 5, 0.2)">recursively call the helper function with both the options and choose the lowest result</span>.
#### Solution
```Java
# Recursion based solution with memoization.
class Solution {
    public int minCostClimbingStairs(int[] cost) {
        return Math.min(helper(cost,0),helper(cost,1));
    }
    HashMap<Integer,Integer> memo = new HashMap<>();
    private int helper(int[] cost, int i) {
        if (memo.containsKey(i)) {
            return memo.get(i);
        }
        if (i >= cost.length) {
            return 0;
        }
        int temp = Math.min(helper(cost,i+1),helper(cost,i+2)) + cost[i];
        memo.put(i,temp);
        return temp;
    }
}
```

### Approach 2 - Tabulation / Iterative Method
- [[02-Areas/DSA/Algorithms/Dynamic Programming#Bottom-Up dynamic programming (Tabulation)\|Dynamic Programming#Bottom-Up dynamic programming (Tabulation)]]

#### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int minCostClimbingStairs(int[] cost) {
        int[] memo = new int[cost.length+1];
        for (int i=0; i<memo.length;i++) {
            memo[i] = 0;
        }
        for (int i=2; i<memo.length;i++) {
            memo[i] = Math.min(memo[i-1] + cost[i-1],memo[i-2] + cost[i-2]);
        }
        return memo[memo.length-1];
    }
}
```
